feat: Implement Docusaurus frontend UI for textbook

This commit completes the implementation of the Docusaurus frontend UI for the
"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook". This involved setting up the
core Docusaurus components and structure, including:

- Hero Section: Integrated with gradient background, title, subtitle, and
  "Start Reading" button.
- Intro / Text Sections: Existing descriptive content verified.
- Modules Cards Section: Integrated with module titles, descriptions, and links.
- Navbar: Configured with textbook title, navigation links, and language/theme toggles.
- Footer: Implemented with copyright information.
- Module Pages: Created entry points (`_category_.json` and `index.md`) for
  each module (1-4), linking to chapter content.

Resolved several build issues during implementation:
- Added missing `prismThemes` import in `docusaurus.config.ts`.
- Removed redundant `themeDropdown` from navbar configuration.
- Corrected image path resolution for `ros2-graph.svg` in `chapter1.md`.
- Restructured module content to resolve MDX parsing errors by removing
  direct inclusion of `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` as content pages
  and instead referencing their location in the `specs/` directory.
- Renamed chapter files to include numerical prefixes for proper sidebar ordering.

All changes have been verified with a successful Docusaurus build.
