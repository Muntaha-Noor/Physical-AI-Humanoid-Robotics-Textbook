# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac AI and Perception

Module 3 dives into the advanced capabilities offered by the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem for AI and perception in robotics. You will learn:

*   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim:** Utilize Isaac Sim, built on NVIDIA Omniverse, for high-fidelity, physically accurate robot simulations. Understand how to work with `.usd` (Universal Scene Description) files for creating and managing complex virtual environments and assets.
*   **NVIDIA Isaac ROS:** Integrate Isaac ROS with your ROS 2 (Humble/Iron) projects to leverage accelerated AI functionalities for robotics, including perception and navigation tasks.
*   **VSLAM and Perception:** Explore Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) techniques for real-time localization and mapping using visual data. Understand how to implement advanced perception algorithms for object detection, tracking, and scene understanding.
*   **Nav2 Integration:** Learn to integrate the Nav2 stack for robust and efficient autonomous navigation of robots in complex environments, utilizing the perception data from Isaac ROS.

This module will equip you with the skills to build highly intelligent robots capable of sophisticated perception and navigation.
