# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Module 4 explores the cutting-edge field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, focusing on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for humanoid robot control. You will learn:

*   **VLA System Architecture:** Understand the integration of visual perception, natural language understanding, and robot action generation to create intelligent agents.
*   **LLM-based Humanoid Control:** Explore techniques for translating natural language commands into robot actions and behaviors using advanced GPT models.
*   **OpenAI API Integration:** Integrate OpenAI's Whisper API for accurate speech-to-text conversion, enabling robots to understand spoken commands.
*   **ROS 2 and LLM Orchestration:** Use `rclpy` to bridge the gap between ROS 2 robotic systems and LLM-based decision-making, allowing for dynamic and intelligent task execution.
*   **Python for LLM Integration:** Develop Python scripts to manage the flow of information between perception systems, LLMs, and robot actuators, especially in diverse simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim).

This module prepares you to develop humanoid robots that can understand and respond to human instructions in a highly intuitive and flexible manner.
