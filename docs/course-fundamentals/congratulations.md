# Course Introduction: Foundations of Physical AI

This section introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI. Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that interact with the real world, often embodied in robots. It combines artificial intelligence, robotics, and control theory to enable machines to perceive, reason, and act within physical environments.

You will learn about the key principles that govern how robots can sense their surroundings, process information, make decisions, and execute actions safely and effectively in dynamic, unstructured settings. This includes understanding the interplay between software intelligence and hardware capabilities, crucial for developing robust and adaptable humanoid robots.
