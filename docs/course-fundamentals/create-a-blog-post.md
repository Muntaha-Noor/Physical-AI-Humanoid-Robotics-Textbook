# Module 1: ROS 2 Basics

Module 1 focuses on the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software. You will learn:

*   **ROS 2 Architecture:** Understand the distributed nature of ROS 2, its nodes, topics, services, and actions.
*   **Communication Mechanisms:** Explore how different components of a robot system communicate using publish-subscribe models, request-reply patterns, and goal-feedback-result patterns.
*   **Python with `rclpy`:** Develop ROS 2 applications using `rclpy`, the Python client library for ROS 2.
*   **Backend Integration:** Learn about integrating ROS 2 with web frameworks like FastAPI, using Qdrant for vector similarity search, and Neon (Postgres) for data persistence.
*   **OpenAI Integration:** Explore how to connect ROS 2 with OpenAI Agents/ChatKit for advanced AI capabilities and intelligent robot behaviors.

By the end of this module, you will be able to set up a basic ROS 2 workspace, create nodes, and establish communication within a robotic system.
