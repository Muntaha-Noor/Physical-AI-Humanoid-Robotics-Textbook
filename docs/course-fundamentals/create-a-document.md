# Module 2: Simulation Basics - Gazebo

Module 2 introduces the fundamental concepts of robotics simulation, focusing on Gazebo (Classic 11 & Fortress). You will learn:

*   **Introduction to Simulation:** Understand the importance of simulation in robotics for testing, development, and training without relying on physical hardware.
*   **Gazebo Environments:** Learn to create and manipulate virtual robot environments using `.world` files, defining physics, sensors, and objects within the simulation.
*   **Robot Models:** Integrate and configure robot models within Gazebo, understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) or SDF (Simulation Description Format) principles.
*   **Running Simulations:** Execute and interact with Gazebo simulations, collecting data and observing robot behavior in a controlled virtual setting.

This module provides the practical skills to build and manage simulation environments essential for any robotics project.
