# Module 2: Simulation Basics - Unity

Continuing with robotics simulation, this section focuses on using Unity (LTS 2022.x) as a powerful simulation platform. You will learn:

*   **Unity for Robotics:** Understand Unity's capabilities for creating high-fidelity 3D environments and complex robotic scenarios.
*   **Asset Integration:** Work with `.unitypackage` files to import and manage 3D models, textures, and other assets within your simulation.
*   **Scripting and Interaction:** Develop C# scripts to control robot behavior, implement sensor logic, and create interactive elements within the Unity environment.
*   **Simulation Data:** Extract and analyze data from Unity simulations to evaluate robot performance and refine control algorithms.

This module provides an alternative and often more visually rich platform for simulating humanoid robots and their environments.
