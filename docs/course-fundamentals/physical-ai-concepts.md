# Key Concepts in Physical AI

Building upon the foundational understanding of ROS 2 and simulation, this section delves into crucial concepts that underpin Physical AI. You will explore:

*   **Embodied Intelligence:** The idea that intelligence is deeply connected to an agent's physical body and its interaction with the environment.
*   **Perception and Sensing:** How robots gather information from their surroundings using various sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, force sensors) and process this data to build an understanding of the world.
*   **Actuation and Control:** The mechanisms and algorithms that allow robots to move and manipulate objects, including motor control, inverse kinematics, and dynamic control strategies.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** Principles for designing robots that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans, considering aspects like shared autonomy, communication, and human-like gestures.
*   **Learning in Physical Systems:** How robots can learn from experience and adapt their behaviors to new situations, including reinforcement learning applied to real-world tasks.

These concepts are vital for developing humanoid robots that are not only capable but also intuitive and safe to interact with.
