# Course Overview: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This course is designed to take you through the foundational and advanced concepts necessary to build and control humanoid robots with intelligence. You will learn a blend of robotics, simulation, and cutting-edge AI technologies.

## What You Will Learn

Throughout this course, you will gain expertise in:

*   **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals:** Understand the core concepts of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), including its architecture, communication mechanisms, and how to develop robotic applications using Python (rclpy). You will explore frameworks like FastAPI, Qdrant, and Neon for robust backend development and integrate with OpenAI Agents/ChatKit for advanced functionalities.
*   **Module 2: Robotics Simulation:** Dive into the world of digital twins using Gazebo (Classic 11 & Fortress) and Unity (LTS 2022.x). Learn to create, manipulate, and simulate complex robotic environments using `.world` files for Gazebo and `.unitypackage` for Unity assets, providing a safe and efficient platform for testing and development.
*   **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac AI Integration:** Explore the powerful NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, including Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS. You will learn to leverage NVIDIA Omniverse for advanced simulation, understand VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), perception, and integrate with Nav2 for robust robot navigation using ROS 2 (Humble/Iron) and `.usd` files for asset description.
*   **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems:** Delve into the exciting field of VLA, focusing on LLM-based humanoid control. You will integrate OpenAI API (Whisper for speech-to-text, GPT models for language understanding) with ROS 2 using `rclpy`. Learn to control humanoid robots through natural language commands, using Python scripts for LLM integration and control in various simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim).

This course provides a holistic view of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, equipping you with the skills to design, simulate, and deploy intelligent robotic systems.
